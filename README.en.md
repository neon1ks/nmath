Fork, replace "Mylib" with the desired name, and it's done.

Build
-----

Building this project, like any other CMake project, consists of two stages:

### Generate a build system

```shell
cmake -S path/to/sources -B path/to/build/directory [options ...]
```

[More about options](#options).

### Build a project

```shell
cmake --build path/to/build/directory [--target target]
```

[More about targets](#targets).

Options
-------

### MYLIB_COVERAGE

```shell
cmake -S ... -B ... -DMYLIB_COVERAGE=ON [other options ...]
```

Turns on the [`coverage`](#coverage) target which performs code coverage measurement.

### MYLIB_TESTING

```shell
cmake -S ... -B ... -DMYLIB_TESTING=OFF [other options ...]
```

Provides the ability to turn off unit testing and hence the [`check`](#check) target. As a result, the code coverage measurement is also turned off (see [Code coverage](#MYLIB_COVERAGE)).

Also, testing is automatically disabled if the project is included to another project as a subproject using the [`add_subdirectory`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.8/command/add_subdirectory.html) command.

### MYLIB_DOXYGEN_LANGUAGE

```shell
cmake -S ... -B ... -DMYLIB_DOXYGEN_LANGUAGE=English [other options ...]
```

Switches the language of the documentation generated by the [`doc`](#doc) target. For a list of available languages, see [Doxygen site](http://www.doxygen.nl/manual/config.html#cfg_output_language).

Default language is Russian.

Targets
-------

### Default

```shell
cmake --build path/to/build/directory
cmake --build path/to/build/directory --target all
```

If a target is not specified (which is equivalent to the `all` target), it builds everything possible including unit tests and also calls the [`check`](#check) target.

### mylib-unit-tests

```shell
cmake --build path/to/build/directory --target mylib-unit-tests
```

Builds unit tests. Enabled by default.

### check

```shell
cmake --build path/to/build/directory --target check
```

Launches built (and builds if not yet) unit tests. Enabled by default.

See also [`mylib-unit-tests`](#mylib-unit-tests).

### coverage

```shell
cmake --build path/to/build/directory --target coverage
```

Analyzes run unit tests (and runs is not yet) using [gcovr](https://gcovr.com).

Target is only available if [`MYLIB_COVERAGE`](#MYLIB_COVERAGE) option is on.

See also [`check`](#check).

### doc

```shell
cmake --build path/to/build/directory --target doc
```

Generates source code documentation using [Doxygen](http://doxygen.nl).

### wandbox

```shell
cmake --build path/to/build/directory --target wandbox
```

The [Wandbox](https://wandbox.org) service is used. Please, don't abuse it.

Examples
--------

#### Building the project in the debug mode and measure a coverage

```shell
cmake -S path/to/sources -B path/to/build/directory -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DMYLIB_COVERAGE=ON
cmake --build path/to/build/directory --target coverage --parallel 16
```

#### Installing the project without building and testing it

```shell
cmake -S path/to/sources -B path/to/build/directory -DMYLIB_TESTING=OFF -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=path/to/install/directory
cmake --build path/to/build/directory --target install
```

#### Building the project in the release mode with a specified compiler

```shell
cmake -S path/to/sources -B path/to/build/directory -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++-8 -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=path/to/installed/dependencies
cmake --build path/to/build/directory --parallel 4
```

#### Generating the documentation in English

```shell
cmake -S path/to/sources -B path/to/build/directory -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DMYLIB_DOXYGEN_LANGUAGE=English
cmake --build path/to/build/directory --target doc
```

Tools
-----

1.  [CMake](https://cmake.org) 3.13

    In fact, version 3.13 is only required to run some of the console commands described in this help. The syntax of all the CMake scripts in this project conforms to version 3.8.

2.  [doctest](https://github.com/onqtam/doctest) testing framework

    Testing might be turned off (see [Testing](#MYLIB_TESTING)).

3.  [Doxygen](http://doxygen.nl)

    Switching the language of the generated documentation is provided by the [`MYLIB_DOXYGEN_LANGUAGE`](#MYLIB_DOXYGEN_LANGUAGE) option.

4.  [Python 3](https://www.python.org) interpreter

    Used to generate an [online sandbox](#wandbox).

Bonus
-----

With CMake and a couple of good tools, you can get a static analysis with minimal effort.

### Cppcheck

CMake has build-in support for [Cppcheck](http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net).

It is provided by the [`CMAKE_CXX_CPPCHECK`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.10/variable/CMAKE_LANG_CPPCHECK.html#variable:CMAKE_<LANG>_CPPCHECK) option:

```shell
cmake -S path/to/sources -B path/to/build/directory -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_CXX_CPPCHECK="cppcheck;--enable=all;-Ipath/to/sources/include"
```

After that, static analysis will be automatically run every time the source code is compiled and recompiled.

### Clang

With [`scan-build`](https://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/scan-build) you can run static analysis easily, too:

```shell
scan-build cmake -S path/to/sources -B path/to/build/directory -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
scan-build cmake --build path/to/build/directory
```

Here, unlike the case of [Cppcheck](#cppcheck) it is required to build the project using `scan-build` each time.
